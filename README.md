## Running the website
To run, clone the repository and directly run the index.html file in your browser. We will probably use React later for better organization.


## Making changes
To make changes, create a new pull request with 
```
git checkout -b branch-name
```

Then commit your changes with
```
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

Finally, push your changes to the branch, which allows you to start and merge your pull request in GitHub
```
git push origin branch-name
```
